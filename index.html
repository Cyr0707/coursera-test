<h4>
	<p>at last
		<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
<p>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
<p>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
<p>And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
<p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
<p>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
<p>And every fair from fair sometime declines,
<p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
<p>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
<p>Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
<p>When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
   <p>So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
   <p>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
